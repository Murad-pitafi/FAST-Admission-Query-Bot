FAST ADMISSION QUERY CHATBOT ‘FASTLY’

## Project Motivation
The admission process at FAST KHI University can be overwhelming for prospective students, leading to confusion and delays in the application process. To address this issue, the admission chatbot is developed with the strategic goal of streamlining the admission process. By providing prompt and accurate responses to admission-related queries, the chatbot aims to reduce the burden on university staff and enhance the overall experience for prospective students.

## Problem Definition
- Specific Output: The admission chatbot predicts relevant responses to admission-related queries posed by prospective students.
- Input Data: The algorithm utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and understand student queries. It leverages historical admission-related data, including frequently asked questions (FAQs), admission policies, and available programs, to provide accurate and relevant responses.
- Relevant Factors: The key factors for predicting the chatbot's output include the content of the query, historical admission data, and the model's ability to comprehend the context and intent of the student's question.

## Relevant Method/Model
- Method/Model: The admission chatbot employs a combination of TensorFlow, neural networks (NN), and NLP techniques. Deep learning algorithms are used to understand input queries, extract pertinent information, and generate appropriate responses.
- Neural Network: The chatbot incorporates a trained neural network that learns from historical data, enabling it to comprehend the context, intent, and semantics of admission-related queries. This facilitates the provision of accurate and contextually appropriate responses to prospective students.

## Performance Measurement
- Accuracy Measurement: The accuracy of the chatbot's predictions can be evaluated by comparing the generated responses with a human-labeled dataset of correct responses. Precision, recall, and F1 score can be employed as evaluation metrics.
- Minimum Accuracy Expectation: The chatbot aims to achieve a minimum accuracy level of 85% in delivering correct and relevant responses to admission-related queries.

## Risks and Dependencies
- Risks:
  - Limited Dataset: The availability of a limited dataset may impact the chatbot's ability to accurately understand and respond to a wide range of queries. To mitigate this risk, the chatbot should be trained on diverse and representative admission-related data.
  - Misinterpretation of Queries: There is a risk of misinterpreting queries due to language variations, grammar issues, or ambiguous phrasing. The chatbot should utilize robust NLP techniques to handle such scenarios and seek clarification if necessary.
- Dependencies:
  - Data Availability: The accuracy and effectiveness of the chatbot rely on the availability of comprehensive and up-to-date admission-related data, including FAQs, admission policies, and program details.

## Run Performance Checks
- Classification Accuracy: The classification accuracy can be calculated by comparing the number of correctly predicted responses against the total number of predictions made by the chatbot. Additionally, a classification report can be generated.

- Confusion Matrix: The confusion matrix provides a visual representation of the chatbot's performance, displaying the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
